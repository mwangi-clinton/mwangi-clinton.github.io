        <p>As we near the end of 2025, I have just realized that it is now one and a half years since I started my Master's degree. While on the outside I may seem to be doing very well, I feel stuck and exhausted, especially after recalling that I have a number of things with deadlines that I need to do.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="the-academic-challenge" class="level2">
        <h2 class="anchored">The Academic Challenge</h2>
        <p>Pursuing a Master's degree, as the name suggests, means mastering a skill or topic and becoming a specialist by doing scientific research. After coursework, I am now in the stage of my program where I need to find a research area, select a topic, and publish a journal paper to be awarded the degree. This is common to all Master's students in Kenya: you need a peer-reviewed, published paper to graduate.</p>

        <p>As a young scientist in my early career, these are the first steps. However, after the first year, I can't make it clear if I need to continue or not. For the last two months, I have been doing a literature review on a topic that interests me, but it is a time-consuming exercise, and I didn’t enjoy any bit of it.</p>
        
        <p>During casual talks with a friend who is actually graduating this year, I learned that reviewing what has been done is the most critical part of research. It is the only way we can know what has been done, what has been tried, and the research direction in the area of interest. This realization has made me look for ways to make this process engaging and entertaining.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="the-uncertainty-and-the-hill" class="level2">
        <h2 class="anchored">The Uncertainty and The "Hill"</h2>
        <p>I am writing this to address my uncertainty about the road ahead in my career; maybe this is the cause of the feeling I have now. Don't get me wrong, I have identified a topic that I am really passionate about, but there is an uncertainty concerning if the material will be publishable or not.</p>

        

        <p>At first, I was excited to read these scientific papers; now, that feels like a humongous hill to climb. I don't know if that is just me, or if everyone has had that feeling in their careers. There is a lack of motivation. I have heard from a number of YouTube videos that you don't need motivation; you need discipline.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="the-physical-connection" class="level2">
        <h2 class="anchored">The Physical Connection</h2>
        <p>I think this feeling of exhaustion is coming partly due to the fact that I am not in the best physical shape. For the majority of this year, I have spent many hours just sitting with little exercise, and maybe this is now making me more exhausted.</p>
        
        <p>To exercise, I need discipline, which I think has been lacking in my life. Also, the art of knowing when to take a break is key. I need to know my body more, know that it has limits, and identify them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="the-plan-for-2026" class="level2">
        <h2 class="anchored">The Plan for 2026</h2>
        <p>The things I need to do starting next year involve organizing my life. I don't want this to be just talk; I want a system that will make me accountable and hold me to every point I make. I have identified these vital steps for 2026, and if you are facing similar issues, I hope these points are helpful to you too.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prioritize physical health</strong>
                <p>I need to prioritize my physical health because being in better shape will greatly influence my mental state—be aware of that connection. Also, being fit provides the energy to make the actual academic work easier. Physical exercise and taking care of my body are vital.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rely on discipline</strong>
                <p>I need to rely on discipline. Finding the discipline and motivation to exercise is the goal. Sometimes you won't feel like it, but finding the zeal and vigor to do it anyway makes the biggest difference. How do soldiers lead disciplined lives? I think it has to do with routine, a sense of responsibility, and knowing that they are expected to do it—and if not, there are consequences. This is what I need.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Start journaling and writing blogs</strong>
                <p>I need to start journaling and writing blogs. I think documenting what I have learned and what I am feeling will be very helpful in knowing where I stand and what I need to do next.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Hoping for a kind 2026!</p>
